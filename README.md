## How It Works

1. The user starts a study session using the timer
2. After completing the session, the user clicks "Finish Session"
3. The user enters study details (major, topic, notes)
4. The session is saved in the browser using LocalStorage
5. The progress graph updates with a new bar
6. The session history is displayed below

## Current Status

This project is a functional static MVP. It includes:

* A working timer system
* Session tracking and logging
* A visual progress graph
* A clean and responsive interface

The application is fully usable through GitHub Pages without requiring a backend server.

---

## Future Improvements

* Daily/weekly aggregated progress tracking
* Improved UI and animations
* User authentication system
* Cloud-based database integration
* Enhanced mobile responsiveness

---

## Team and Development

This project was developed collaboratively by:

- Cole Fetterman — Project Structure, Integration, and Deployment  
- Nelson Copete — Styling, Layout Design, and UI Enhancements  
- Zamman Qureshi — JavaScript Logic, Timer Functionality, and Data Handling  

Development was conducted collaboratively through group sessions over Discord, where all team members worked together in real time on the project.

While each member was assigned primary responsibilities, all components of the project were developed with shared input, discussion, and teamwork across the entire group.

---

## Development Notes

During development, the project transitioned from a full-stack application into a static version to simplify deployment and ensure reliability when hosted through GitHub Pages.

LocalStorage was implemented to simulate backend functionality, allowing session data to persist without requiring a database.

This approach ensured the project remained functional, accessible, and aligned with the goals of the assignment.
